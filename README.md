Theme
================================================================================

Boiler template theme for silverstripe install.

The simple theme in this "module" is an altered copy of the
Silverstripe Simple theme (https://github.com/silverstripe-themes/silverstripe-simple).

We have added it to this theme folder not because it is our work,
but to make it easier for developers to make a start in using sunnysideup/ecommerce.

If you would like to add your theme to this collection then please contact the author.
